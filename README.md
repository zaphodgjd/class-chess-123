# Chess AI Implementation Project

![Chess Board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaphodgjd/class-chess-123/main/chess/w_king.png)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This repository contains a skeleton implementation of a Chess AI engine written in C++. The project is designed to teach fundamental concepts of game AI, including board representation, move generation, and basic game tree search algorithms.

### 🎓 Educational Purpose
This project serves as a teaching tool for computer science students to understand:
- Game state representation
- Object-oriented design in C++
- Basic AI concepts in game playing
- Bitboard operations and chess piece movement
- FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation) for chess position representation

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Key Components
1. **Chess Class**: Core game logic implementation
   - Board state management
   - Move validation
   - Game state evaluation
   - AI player implementation

2. **Piece Representation**
   - Unique identifiers for each piece type
   - Sprite loading and rendering
   - Movement pattern definitions

3. **Board Management**
   - 8x8 grid representation
   - Piece positioning
   - Move history tracking
   - FEN notation support

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++11 support or higher
- Image loading library for piece sprites
- CMake 3.10 or higher

### Building the Project
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running Tests
```bash
./chess_tests
```

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Current Features
- Basic board setup and initialization
- Piece movement validation framework
- FEN notation parsing and generation
- Sprite loading for chess pieces
- Player turn management

### Planned Features
- [ ] AI move generation
- [ ] Position evaluation
- [ ] Opening book integration
- [ ] Advanced search algorithms
- [ ] Game state persistence

## 🔍 Code Examples

### Piece Movement Validation
```cpp
bool Chess::canBitMoveFromTo(Bit& bit, BitHolder& src, BitHolder& dst) {
    // TODO: Implement piece-specific movement rules
    return false;
}
```

### FEN Notation Generation
```cpp
const char Chess::bitToPieceNotation(int row, int column) const {
    if (row < 0 || row >= 8 || column < 0 || column >= 8) {
        return '0';
    }
    // Implementation details for FEN notation
}
```

## 📚 Class Assignment Structure

### Phase 3: AI Implementation
- Develop position evaluation
- Implement minimax algorithm
- Add alpha-beta pruning
- Basic opening book
